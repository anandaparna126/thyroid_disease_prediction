# Thyroid Disease Prediction using Deep Learning

This repository contains a deep learning model for predicting thyroid disease using data from the Garavan Institute, Sydney.

## Dataset Information

The dataset used for this project is obtained from the Garavan Institute, Sydney. It contains various features related to patients' health status and thyroid disease diagnosis.

## Files

- **data.csv**: This CSV file contains the raw data used for training and testing the deep learning model.
- **Thyroid_Disease_Prediction.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code for preprocessing the data, building and training the deep learning model, and evaluating its performance.
- **model.h5**: This file contains the trained deep learning model saved in HDF5 format.

## Model Architecture

The deep learning model used for thyroid disease prediction consists of multiple layers of neural networks, including dense layers, activation functions, and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.

## How to Use

To use the thyroid disease prediction model:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed, along with the required libraries specified in the Jupyter Notebook (`Thyroid_Disease_Prediction.ipynb`).
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Thyroid_Disease_Prediction.ipynb` and follow the instructions to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
4. Once trained, you can use the model for predicting thyroid disease on new data.

## Results

The model performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are provided in the Jupyter Notebook after training and evaluating the model.
